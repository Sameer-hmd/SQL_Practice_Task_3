## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### 1. ✅ SELECT * and Specific Columns
- Retrieve all columns from a table using `SELECT *`
- Retrieve specific columns like `Title`, `Author`, or `JoinDate` to limit output

### 2. ✅ WHERE Conditions with AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN
- Use `WHERE` to filter data based on conditions
- Combine multiple conditions using `AND` / `OR`
- Search patterns with `LIKE` (e.g., books starting with "The")
- Filter numeric/date ranges using `BETWEEN`

### 3. ✅ ORDER BY for Sorting Results
- Sort results alphabetically or numerically using `ORDER BY`
- Use `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) to control order
